## Introduction
This project predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit, based on data from the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Implementation of two models: **Neural Networks** and **Random Forest**
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 41,188 records with 21 features, categorized into:
- **Client Data**: Information about the customer (e.g., age, job, marital status, etc.)
- **Campaign-Related Variables**: Campaign details like communication type and last contact timing.
- **Economic Indicators**: External factors such as employment variation rate and consumer price index.

The target variable is binary (`y`), indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (`yes`/`no`).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to uncover patterns and correlations within the dataset. Key findings include:
- The dataset is imbalanced, with most customers not subscribing to term deposits.
- Some features exhibit strong correlations, such as `euribor3m`, `nr.employed`, and `emp.var.rate`.
- Outliers were detected in several numerical features.

## Preprocessing
Key steps in preprocessing include:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: The dataset has no explicit missing values but includes "unknown" labels for categorical features.
2. **Dropping Irrelevant Features**: Columns such as `duration` and `pdays` were dropped due to irrelevance or redundancy.
3. **Encoding**: Categorical features were one-hot encoded.
4. **Balancing the Dataset**: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to handle class imbalance.
5. **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features were standardized for uniformity.
6. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce multicollinearity among highly correlated features.

## Models Used
1. **Neural Network (NN)**: 
   - Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Architecture: Two hidden layers with ReLU activation and a sigmoid output layer.
2. **Random Forest (RF)**:
   - Implemented using Scikit-learn.
   - A robust ensemble model with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics were used for model evaluation:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **ROC-AUC** (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)

## Results
| Metric             | Random Forest | Neural Network |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Training Accuracy  | 0.9369        | 0.91           |
| Testing Accuracy   | 0.9156        | 0.9212         |
| ROC-AUC           | 0.97          | 0.97           |

   cd Predict-Term-Deposit-Subscription
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
The analysis and code are implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named `predict_term_deposit_subscription.ipynb`. 

### Steps to Run:
1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook predict_term_deposit_subscription.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the models.
   - Evaluate the performance.

## Future Work
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improve model performance using techniques like Grid Search.
- **Explore Advanced Models**: Implement models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost.
- **Additional Features**: Incorporate more domain-specific features to enhance predictions.
